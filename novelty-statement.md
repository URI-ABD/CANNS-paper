This work significantly extends prior work by some of the authors: "Entropy-scaling search of massive biological data" (Yu, et al. 2015), "Clustered hierarchical entropy-scaling search of astronomical and biological data" (Ishaq, et al. 2019), and "Clustered hierarchical anomaly and outlier detection algorithms" (Ishaq, et al. 2021). The particular novelty here is a collection of fast, sublinear-time k-nearest-neighbor search algorithms (the previous work focused on range, or rho-nearest-neighbor, search). We also believe there is a novel analysis and discussion of the nature of real-world (e.g. naturally occurring datasets).
