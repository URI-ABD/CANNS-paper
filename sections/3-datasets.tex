\label{sec:datasets-and-distance-functions}

\subsection{APOGEE-2}
\label{subsec:datasets:apogee-2}
The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) [3] Apache Point Observatory Galaxy Evolution
Experiment (APOGEE) [4] contains near-infrared
spectra of approximately 130,000 stellar objects in the Milky
Way galaxy. Each spectral datum describes a star's flux in
Janskys ($1 Jy = 10^{-26} W \dot m^{-2} \dot Hz^{-1}$) at each of 8,575 wavelengths ranging from $\lambda$ = 1.51 µm to 1.70 µm. 
Thus, each datum is a real-valued vector in $\mathbb{R}_{+}^{8575}$. 

Astronomers use these near-infrared spectra to achieve a better understanding of our galaxy's history. This dataset 
is often used with Euclidean (L2) distance, cosine distance, and 1d-Wasserstein distance. As explained in~\cite{ishaq2019clustered},
this dataset is a good candidate for entropy-scaling search algorithms like CAKES because it exhibits low fractal dimension. 

\subsection{MaNGA}
\label{subsec:datasets:manga}
SDSS's Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) [CITE] contains spectral measurements across the face of each of 
about 10,000 galaxies across 2,700 deg$^2$. 

Like APOGEE, MaNGA helps astronomers understand the history of galaxies throughout their entire lifespan. This 
dataset is typically used with Euclidean (L2) distance, cosine distance, and 2d-Wasserstein distance. 


\subsection{Silva 18S}
\label{subsec:datasets:silva-18s}

Silva 18S contains ribosomal DNA sequences of approximately 2.25 
million genomes with aligned length of 50,000 letters. 


These sequences help biologists better understand the evolutionary relationships between organisms. 
This dataset is typically used with Hamming and Levenshtein distances. 


\subsection{ANN-Benchmarks suite}
\label{subsec:datasets:ann-benchmarks-suite}

We benchmark on a variety of datasets from the ann-benchmarks suite~\cite{Aumller2018ANNBenchmarksAB}, 
listed below, along with the appropriate distance function: 

\begin{itemize} 
    \item DEEP1B (Cosine): $\sim$1 billion 96-dimensional deep descriptors to 
    \item Fashion-MNIST (Euclidean): 60,000 784-dimensional vector representations of images of clothing items
