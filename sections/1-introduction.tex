Write intro \dots

- introduce kNN~\cite{fix1952discriminatory, cover1967nearest} as one of the most pervasive supervised classification methods in use
- performance difficulties of naive kNN, and introduce existing improvements such as locality-sensitive hashing~\cite{bingham2001random}
- Introduce Compressed Accelerated K-nearest-neighbor Entropy-scaling Search (CAKES)

Growth in size and types of datasets:
\begin{itemize}
    \item SDSS APOGEE2 data. Near-infrared spectra of approximately 430,000 stars in approximately 9,000 dimensions. $R=22,500 = \frac{\lambda}{\Delta \lambda}$ for $\lambda \in [1.51, 1.70) \mu m$
    \item SDSS MaNGA hexagon shaped images. 10,000 galaxies with 2,700 deg$^2$, resolution $R=2,000$ for $\lambda \in [360, 1000) nm$
    \item Silva 18S ribosomal DNA sequences of approximately 2.25 million genomes with aligned length of 50,000 letters. TODO: Look into other variants in the dataset particularly NR99.
    \item Datasets from ANN-Benchmarks suite
\end{itemize}

Recent approaches in dealing with exponential growth of data:
\begin{itemize}
    \item LSH
    \item clever indexing e.g. FM Index.
    \item Entropy-scaling search~\cite{yu2015entropy} and CHESS~\cite{ishaq2019clustered}.
\end{itemize}

This paper focuses on:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Improvements and extensions of CHESS.
    \item Accelerated $\rho$-nearest and k-nearest neighbors search.
    \item Entropy-scaling (?? is it though?) compression using the hierarchical clustering.
    \item Proof for how cluster-radii, and thus compression deltas, fall as we descend along the tree.
    \item Information theoretic bounds on compression performance. We compress along the dimensionality of data rather than the cardinality of data.
    \item A variety of distance functions including euclidean, manhattan, cosine, jaccard, wasserstein, hamming, levenshtein, needleman-wunch, and any user-defined function.
\end{itemize}

Comparisons for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Search time vs FALCONN and other in ann-benchmarks suite.
    \item Compression performance of CAKES+gzip vs just gzip.
\end{itemize}
