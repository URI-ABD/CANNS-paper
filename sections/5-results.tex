Specs of Ark, and maybe M1 MacBook Air and Dell XPS.

Ark: a 28-core Intel Xeon E5-2690 v4 2.60GHz, 512GB RAM and CentOS 7 Linux with kernel 3.10.0-1127.13.1.el7.x86\_64 \#1 SMP. Rust 1.52, Python 3.6.8

Macbook Air: 8-core (4 performance, 4 efficiency) Apple M1 processor with 16GB RAM, macOS 11.3. Rust 1.52, Python 3.9.4

For each pair $(X, f)$ and a small selection of depths, measure:
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
    \item linear search vs accelerated search:
    \begin{enumerate}[i.]
        \item runtime performance,
        \item speedup factor, and
        \item number of distance comparisons.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Compression CAKES + zlib vs just zlib, also substitute other libraries for zlib:
    \begin{enumerate}[i.]
        \item just the encoding vs the full dataset,
        \item encoding + serialization, and
        \item encoding + serialization + zlib.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Measure time taken for accelerated-search in the compressed space and decompression of the hits with different combinations of serde and codec libraries.
\end{enumerate}

Find the optimal clusters for compression.
Compare linear search vs accelerated search terminated at these optimal clusters.
